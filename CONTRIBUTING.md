## Reporting Issues

Found a problem? Want a new feature? There is no right or wrong - as long as it makes you happy and doesn’t hurt anyone.

- If you don’t like it - change it. It’s your world.
- See if your issue or idea has [already been reported].
- Provide a [reduced test case] or a [live example].
- Just let it happen. The only rule is that you should enjoy this

Remember, a bug is a _demonstrable problem_ caused by _our_ code.

## Submitting Pull Requests

Pull requests are the greatest contributions, so be sure they are focused in scope, and do avoid unrelated commits. Work on one thing at a time. Don’t get carried away - we have plenty of time.

1. To begin, [fork this project], clone your fork, and add our upstream.
   ```bash
   # Clone your fork of the repo into the current directory
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/postcss-bob-ross-palette
   # Navigate to the newly cloned directory
   cd postcss-bob-ross-palette
   # Assign the original repo to a remote called "upstream"
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/jonathantneal/postcss-bob-ross-palette
   # Install the tools necessary for development
   npm install
   # In your world you have total and absolute power
   # Just take out whatever you don’t want.
   # It’ll change your entire perspective.
   ```

2. Create a branch for your feature or fix:
   ```bash
   # Move into a new branch for a feature
   # You can do anything your heart can imagine.
   # You can create anything that makes you happy
   git checkout -b feature/thing
   ```
   ```bash
   # Move into a new branch for a fix
   # Sometimes you learn more from your mistakes
   # than you do from your masterpieces
   git checkout -b fix/something
   ```

3. Be sure your code follows our practices.
   ```bash
   # Test current code
   # Don’t hurry
   # Take your time and enjoy
   npm run test
   ```

4. Push your branch up to your fork:
   ```bash
   # Push a feature branch
   # However you think it should be.
   # That’s exactly how it should be.
   git push origin feature/thing
   ```
   ```bash
   # Push a fix branch
   # Even the worst thing we can do here is good.
   git push origin fix/something
   ```

5. Now [open a pull request] with a clear title and description.

You have freedom here. The only guide is your heart. We don’t really know where this goes - and I’m not sure we really care.
